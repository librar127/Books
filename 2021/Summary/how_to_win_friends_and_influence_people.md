Part 3: How to win people to your way of thinking
=================================================
01. **You can't win with an Argument**
      * Try to avoid it anyhow; what ever you can
      * You can never win with the argument enen if you win. You may get the triumph sometime but it will be empty victory as it will never have other person's goodwill.
      * ""Hatred is never ended by hatred but by Love" - Buddha
      * Suggesstions to keep disagreement from becomming arguments:
         * **Welcome the disagreement** - It might be good as it might bring something you haven't though about it.It might make you correct about something.
         * **Distrust your first instinctive impression** - Our first reaction might be difensive; Be careful, keep kalm and watch it out.
         * **Control your temper**
         * **Listen first** - It might bring some good point which you realize you haven't though about it.
         * **Look for the areas of the agreement** - It might cool down your opponent and take the argument a little politely.
         * **Be honest** - Accept the good points made by the opponent and think about the mistakes and no shame appolizing the mistakes.
         * **Think again your opponent and validate the points mentioned by him / her as it may be right**
         * **Thank your opponent sincerely for their interest;** Since they are into argument, it shows their interest in the same topic which can a great thing and finally you might agree at something later and might become friend as well.
         * **Postpone the argument and allow some time in between to think as well as collect some evidence** - This time will also give you possibility to rething what you gain from this agrgument even if you win or loose it? what impact it will have on my opponent i.e will make him / her closer or draw them away.
02. **Don't prove other people wrong - Show some respect for their opinion**
      * It only hurt their self-respect and want them to attack back but it never make them change their minds. 
      * Don't prove as you are smarter than them; it will hurt their feelings and they might not accept you no matter what you try.
      * A Beautiful line by Galileo - "You can never teach a man anything; you can only  help him find it within himself" 
      * Lord Chesterfield as he said to his son - "Be wiser than other people if you can but do not tell them so"
      * Socrates to his followers - "One thing only I know that I know nothing"
      * Try to phrase as - 'I might be worng; I frequently am. Let's examine the fact'. This may lead to some agreement and opponent might realise he may be wrong too.
      * When someone expressses their feelings, attitude or belief, our first (almost instant) impression is the judgement rather than understanding of it that's where lies the problem, we should try to understand it.
      * Read Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography
      * Don't agrue with your customer, boss, spouse etc. Do not tell them as they are wrong; show them respect for their opinion and be diplomatic sometime.
03. **Admit it if you are wrong**  
      * Accept the mistake by yourself if you feel wrong rather than someone point it out to you you and make you feel wrong.
      * It gives the satisfaction to have the courage to admit the mistake and own it and promise to correct it ant not repeat it.
      * When someone tries to prove you wrong - 1. And you are right, try to treat / win people gently and tactfully 2. But when you are wrong, be honest and have courage to admit it and learn from mistakes with all our heart. Appreciate the person for pointing it out or making you learn.
      * As old saying - "By fighting you never get enough but by yielding you get more then you expected"
04. **Begin with friendliness**
      * Gentleness and friendliness is always better than fury and force.
      * Friendly approach and appreciation can make people change their minds more quickly than all the blusters and storming in the world.
05. **Secret of Socrates**
      * While discussing with people, don't start emphasize the points which you disagree rather start with what you agree on. This will kick off friendly start.
      * Get the opponent to say "yes, yes" by posing the question instead of temptation of saying them wrong.
06. **Let the other person talk to express himself**
      * Do not try to win a person by your way of thinking. Let him talk and express and do not interupt as he might have a lot to share and might not listen to you.
